Compresses files by substituting words with the help of a dictionary.

NOTE: This is a project for getting in touch with Haskell.
      It's probably not useful at all, because only long text files are going to become smaller
      after compression.

Usage:

Compile with "ghc comp" and "ghc decomp"

COMP usage:   "./comp [input file] [output file]"
DECOMP usage: "./decomp [input file] [output file]"

The input should only be plain text.
